On versions prior to Android N (24), initializing the WifiManager via Context#getSystemService can cause a memory leak if the context is not the application context.

In many cases, it's not obvious from the code where the Context is coming from (e.g. it might be a parameter to a method, or a field initialized from various method calls). It's possible that the context being passed in is the application context, but to be on the safe side, you should consider changing context.getSystemService(...) to context.getApplicationContext().getSystemService(...).

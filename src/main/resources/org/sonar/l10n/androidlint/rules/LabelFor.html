<p>
Editable text fields should provide an android:hint or, provided your minSdkVersion is at least 17, they may be referenced by a view with a android:labelFor attribute. 
</p>
<p>
When using android:labelFor, be sure to provide an android:text or an android:contentDescription. 
</p>
<p>
If your view is labeled but by a label in a different layout which includes this one, just suppress this warning from lint.

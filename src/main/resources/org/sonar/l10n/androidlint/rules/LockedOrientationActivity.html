<p>
NOTE: This issue is disabled by default! You can enable it by adding --enable LockedOrientationActivity 
</p>
<p>
The &lt;activity&gt; element should not be locked to any orientation so that users can take advantage of the multi-window environments and larger screens on Chrome OS. To fix the issue, consider declaring the corresponding activity element with `screenOrientation=&quot;unspecified&quot;or &quot;fullSensor&quot;` attribute.

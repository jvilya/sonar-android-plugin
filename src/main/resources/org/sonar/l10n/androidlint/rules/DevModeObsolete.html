<p>
In the past, our documentation recommended creating a dev product flavor with has a minSdkVersion of 21, in order to enable multidexing to speed up builds significantly during development. 
</p>
<p>
That workaround is no longer necessary, and it has some serious downsides, such as breaking API access checking (since the true minSdkVersion is no longer known). 
</p>
<p>
In recent versions of the IDE and the Gradle plugin, the IDE automatically passes the API level of the connected device used for deployment, and if that device is at least API 21, then multidexing is automatically turned on, meaning that you get the same speed benefits as the dev product flavor but without the downsides.

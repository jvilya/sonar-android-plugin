Notification icons should define a raster image to support Android versions below 5.0 (API 21). Note that the way Lint decides whether an icon is a notification icon is based on the filename prefix ic_stat_. This corresponds to the naming convention documented in <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html">http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html</a>

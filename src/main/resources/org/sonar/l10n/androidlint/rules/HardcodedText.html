<p>
Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several reasons: 
</p>
<p>

<br>* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes) 
</p>
<p>

<br>* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources. 
</p>
<p>
There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup.

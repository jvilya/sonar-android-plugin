Assertions will never be turned on in Android. (It was possible to enable it in Dalvik with adb shell setprop debug.assert 1, but it is not implemented in ART, the runtime for Android 5.0 and later.) 
</p>
<p>
This means that the assertion will never catch mistakes, and you should not use assertions from Java or Kotlin for debug build checking. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, perform conditional checking inside if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { } blocks. That constant is a static final boolean which will be true only in debug builds, and false in release builds, and the compiler will completely remove all code inside the if-body from the app. 
</p>
<p>
For example, you can replace     assert(speed &gt; 0, { &quot;Message&quot; })    // Kotlin     assert speed &gt; 0 : &quot;Message&quot;        // Java with     if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &amp;&amp; !(speed &gt; 0)) {         throw new AssertionError(&quot;Message&quot;)     } (Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or non-nullness in Java code; these are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime checks.)

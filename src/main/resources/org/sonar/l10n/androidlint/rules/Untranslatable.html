Strings can be marked with translatable=false to indicate that they are not intended to be translated, but are present in the resource file for other purposes (for example for non-display strings that should vary by some other configuration qualifier such as screen size or API level).

<p>
There are cases where translators accidentally translate these strings anyway, and lint will flag these occurrences with this lint check.

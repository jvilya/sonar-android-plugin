Specify an autofillHints attribute when targeting SDK version 26 or higher or explicitly specify that the view is not important for autofill. Your app can help an autofill service classify the data correctly by providing the meaning of each view that could be autofillable, such as views representing usernames, passwords, credit card fields, email addresses, etc. 
</p>
<p>
The hints can have any value, but it is recommended to use predefined values like 'username' for a username or 'creditCardNumber' for a credit card number. For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the AUTOFILL_HINT_ constants in the View reference at <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.</a> 
</p>
<p>
You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an importantForAutofill attribute on that view or a parent view. See <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportantFor">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportantFor</a> Autofill(int).

The default orientation of a LinearLayout is horizontal. It's pretty easy to
believe that the layout is vertical, add multiple children to it, and wonder
why only the first child is visible (when the subsequent children are off
screen to the right). This lint rule helps pinpoint this issue by warning
whenever a LinearLayout is used with an implicit orientation and multiple
children.

It also checks for empty LinearLayouts without an orientation attribute that
also defines an id attribute. This catches the scenarios where children will
be added to the LinearLayout dynamically.

BIND_LISTENER receives all Android Wear events whether the application needs them or not. This can be inefficient and cause applications to wake up unnecessarily. With Google Play Services 8.2.0 or later it is recommended to use a more efficient combination of manifest listeners and api-based live listeners filtered by action, path and/or path prefix.

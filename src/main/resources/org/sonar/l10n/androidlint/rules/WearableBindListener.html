BIND_LISTENER receives all Android Wear events whether the application needs
them or not. This can be inefficient and cause applications to wake up
unnecessarily. With Google Play Services 8.2.0 or later it is recommended to
use a more efficient combination of manifest listeners and api-based live
listeners filtered by action, path and/or path prefix.

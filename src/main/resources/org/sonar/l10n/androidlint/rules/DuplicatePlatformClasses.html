There are a number of libraries that duplicate not just functionality of the
Android platform but using the exact same class names as the ones provided in
Android -- for example the apache http classes. This can lead to unexpected
crashes.

To solve this, you need to either find a newer version of the library which no
longer has this problem, or to repackage the library (and all of its
dependencies) using something like the jarjar tool, or finally, rewriting the
code to use different APIs (for example, for http code, consider using
HttpUrlConnection or a library like okhttp.)

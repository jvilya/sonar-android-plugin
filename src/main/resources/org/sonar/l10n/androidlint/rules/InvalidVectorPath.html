This check ensures that vector paths are valid. For example, it makes sure that the numbers are not using scientific notation (such as 1.0e3) which can lead to runtime crashes on older devices. As another example, it flags numbers like .5 which should be written as 0.5 instead to avoid crashes on some pre-Marshmallow devices.

The @IntDef annotation allows you to create a light-weight &quot;enum&quot; or type definition. However, it's possible to accidentally specify the same value for two or more of the values, which can lead to hard-to-detect bugs. This check looks for this scenario and flags any repeated constants.

In some cases, the repeated constant is intentional (for example, renaming a constant to a more intuitive name, and leaving the old name in place for compatibility purposes.)  In that case, simply suppress this check by adding a @SuppressLint(&quot;UniqueConstants&quot;) annotation.

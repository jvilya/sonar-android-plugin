NOTE: This issue is disabled by default! You can enable it by adding --enable SyntheticAccessor

<p>
A private inner class which is accessed from the outer class will force the compiler to insert a synthetic accessor; this means that you are causing extra overhead. This is not important in small projects, but is important for large apps running up against the 64K method handle limit, and especially for libraries where you want to make sure your library is as small as possible for the cases where your library is used in an app running up against the 64K limit.

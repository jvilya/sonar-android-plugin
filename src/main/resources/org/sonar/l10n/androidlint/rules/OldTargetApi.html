When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

NOTE: This issue is disabled by default! You can enable it by adding --enable DalvikOverride 
</p>
<p>
The Dalvik virtual machine will treat a package private method in one class as overriding a package private method in its super class, even if they are in separate packages. 
</p>
<p>
If you really did intend for this method to override the other, make the method protected instead. 
</p>
<p>
If you did not intend the override, consider making the method private, or changing its name or signature. 
</p>
<p>
Note that this check is disabled be default, because ART (the successor to Dalvik) no longer has this behavior.

NOTE: This issue is disabled by default! You can enable it by adding --enable SourceLockedOrientationActivity 
</p>
<p>
The Activity should not be locked to any orientation so that users can take advantage of the multi-window environments and larger screens available on Chrome OS. To fix the issue, consider calling setRequestedOrientation with the ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_FULL_SENSOR or ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_UNSPECIFIED options or removing the call all together.

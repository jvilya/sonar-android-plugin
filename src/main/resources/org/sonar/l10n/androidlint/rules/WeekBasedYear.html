NOTE: This issue is disabled by default! You can enable it by adding --enable WeekBasedYear 
</p>
<p>
The DateTimeFormatter pattern YYYY returns the week based year, not the era-based year. This means that 12/29/2019 will format to 2019, but 12/30/2019 will format to 2020! 
</p>
<p>
If you expected this to format as 2019, you should use the pattern yyyy instead.

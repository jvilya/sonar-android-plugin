Providing an inputType attribute on a text field improves usability because depending on the data to be input, optimized keyboards can be shown to the user (such as just digits and parentheses for a phone number). Similarly,a hint attribute displays a hint to the user for what is expected in the text field.

The lint detector also looks at the id of the view, and if the id offers a hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the id contains the phrase phone or email), then lint will also ensure that the inputType contains the corresponding type attributes.

If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this warning by setting inputType=&quot;text&quot;.
